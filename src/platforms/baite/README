This adapts the Black Magic firmware for the ST-Link v2 clone from Baite (betemcu.cn).
It is based on a STM32F103.

connector
=========

Black Magic Probe (Baite) pinout:
     _____
SRST |1 2| +3.3V
 +5V |3 4| JTCK/SWCLK
  RX  5 6| JTMS/SWDIO
 GND |7 8| JTDO/TRACESWO
  TX |910| JTDI
     -----

flashing
========

Program the adapter using the UART port on the back through the serial bootloader.

UART port:
1 RX (square)
2 TX
3 BOOT0 (set high when powering the board to start the serial bootloader)
4 +5V
5 GND

Disable flash read/write protection to be able to write firmware.

notes
=====

All connector pins have 220 ohms inline resistors.
RX is pulled high using a 620 ohms resistor (the TX board need to pull low strong enough to transmit signal).
PB6/PB7 (UART1) are remapped in the firmware to provide TX/RX.
TRACESWO (TIM3_CH1) should be supported has not been tested.
Short RX to GND (pin 5 and 7) to force entering DFU bootloader mode.
